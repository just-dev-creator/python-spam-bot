If you still want to tell me something important about this, please use the email on my profile page.

Please consider the following before using any of this code:
- There might be security flaws in this code, f.ex. cause of outdated packages.
- The code might not be written and documented verry well. There might be debugging still in it.
- I suggest reading the code first to check for the first two points if you want to use it.
